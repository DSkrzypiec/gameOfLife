# Conway's Game of Life

## About
This micro project was about to checkout `SDL2` C and C++ library for graphics.
**TODO**

![Test](gameOfLife.gif)

## Compilation

For compilation I'm using C++17 (almost surely C++11 would be enough) and I've `SDL2` library installed. 
For Ubuntu one can easy install `SDL2` library using 

```
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

Next you can use 

```
./compile
./gameOfLife
```

to compile the source code and run the game.

## Configuration

Most of the game parameters can be passed through command arguments.
